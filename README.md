# Baby-s-First-Encryption-Test
This is an extremely simple program that writes an encrypted message x amount of times to a file using a rudimentary method of encryption. Its meant to highlight the importance of hashmaps and complex encryption solutions rather than easy to decipher or hardcoded solutions in order to protect information. When this program is looped enough times, the message is actually decrypted by using the same method of encryption too many times.
