# Baby-s-First-Encryption-Test
This is an extremely simple program that writes an encrypted message x amount of times to the console using a rudimentary method of encryption. When this program is looped enough times, the message is actually decrypted by using the same method of encryption too many times. New encryption methods will be added over time.
